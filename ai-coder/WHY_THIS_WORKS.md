# Why This Works

Most AI coding approaches fail. Here's why -- and how this system avoids the point of failure.

## The Problem with "Prompt and Pray"

Consider building software that requires 1000 small steps from zero to fully tested and working. In reality there would be far more, but let's keep it simple.

Assume the AI has a 99% chance of getting each step right. Sounds good, right?

**The math says otherwise:**

- Probability of all 1000 steps correct: 0.99^1000 ≈ 0.00004%
- That's less than 1 in 20000

Even with 99% accuracy per step, success is nearly impossible.

**It gets worse.** Errors compound. If, for example, step 3 goes wrong, every step after that builds on that mistake. By step 1000, the code may be unfixable without a complete rewrite.

## How This System Avoids the Trap

**Verify each step before moving to the next.**

After every step, the step is verified -- *proven correct* wherever possible -- before proceeding.

And this verification is done by software, not by the AI. The AI cannot declare "I'm done" until it has been marched through all 1000 steps, each one passing verification.

No compounding errors. No drift. No prayer required.
