You are an AI assistant tasked with cleaning up orphan requirement tags from tests and code.

## What Are Orphan $REQ_IDs?

An **orphan $REQ_ID** is a requirement tag that appears in test files or code files but does **NOT** exist in any flow file under `./reqs/`.

This happens when:
- Requirements were removed from flows but references weren't cleaned up
- Tests or code referenced $REQ_IDs that were never defined
- Flow files were restructured and some $REQ_IDs were deleted

---

## Your Task

Remove all orphan $REQ_ID tags from tests and code files.

You will be provided with a list of orphan $REQ_IDs and their locations.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Review the Orphan List

You will receive a list like:
```
  $REQ_STARTUP_999:
    - ./tests/failing/startup.py:42
    - ./code/server.py:156
  $REQ_INVALID_001:
    - ./tests/passing/validation.py:78
```

### Step 2: Remove Tags from Files

For each file listed:
1. Open the file
2. Find the orphan $REQ_ID tags
3. Remove or update the lines containing those tags

**How to remove depends on context:**

**In tests (assertions with comments):**
```python
# Before:
assert server.is_running()  # $REQ_STARTUP_999

# After:
assert server.is_running()  # Remove the comment entirely
```

**In code (implementation comments):**
```csharp
// Before:
public void StartServer()
{
    // $REQ_STARTUP_999: Launch the server process
    Process.Start("server.exe");
}

// After:
public void StartServer()
{
    // Launch the server process
    Process.Start("server.exe");
}
```

**If entire test assertion is only for orphan req:**
```python
# Before:
def test_startup():
    server = Server()
    server.start()
    assert server.is_running()  # $REQ_STARTUP_999
    assert server.port == 43143  # $REQ_STARTUP_002

# After (if only $REQ_STARTUP_999 is orphan):
def test_startup():
    server = Server()
    server.start()
    # Removed orphan assertion for $REQ_STARTUP_999
    assert server.port == 43143  # $REQ_STARTUP_002
```

### Step 3: Update Tests if Needed

If removing orphan tags causes a test to become empty or meaningless:
- Remove the entire test function
- Or update it to test only valid requirements

---

## Useful Tools

**Track requirement IDs:** To get information about a `$REQ_ID` (definition, source, test coverage, implementation locations):

```bash
{{UV_BINARY}} run --script ./ai-coder/scripts/track-reqIDs.py $REQ_ID
```

You can also pass multiple IDs or use `--req-file ./reqs/file.md` to trace all IDs in a file.

---

## Important Notes

- **Only remove the specified orphan $REQ_IDs** -- do not remove other tags
- **Preserve code functionality** -- removing tags should not break working code
- **Be surgical** -- only modify lines containing orphan tags

---

## Example

### Input:
```
Orphan $REQ_IDs to remove:
  $REQ_AUTH_999:
    - ./tests/failing/auth.py:23
  $REQ_INVALID_001:
    - ./code/auth.py:67
```

### File: ./tests/failing/auth.py (before)
```python
def test_authentication():
    user = User("alice", "password123")
    assert user.authenticate()  # $REQ_AUTH_999
    assert user.has_permission("read")  # $REQ_AUTH_002
```

### File: ./tests/failing/auth.py (after)
```python
def test_authentication():
    user = User("alice", "password123")
    # Removed orphan $REQ_AUTH_999
    assert user.has_permission("read")  # $REQ_AUTH_002
```

### File: ./code/Auth.cs (before)
```csharp
public bool Authenticate(string username, string password)
{
    // $REQ_INVALID_001: Validate credentials
    return CheckCredentials(username, password);
}
```

### File: ./code/Auth.cs (after)
```csharp
public bool Authenticate(string username, string password)
{
    // Validate credentials
    return CheckCredentials(username, password);
}
```

## Summary

1. Review the list of orphan $REQ_IDs and their locations
2. Remove or clean up the orphan tags from each file
3. Preserve all working code and non-orphan requirements
