# Req Fix 01 Cli [RESPONSE]
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-14-12-50-47-902
**Requirement:** N/A

---

## Response

Done. I made one fix to the requirements document:

**$REQ_CLI_013** was updated to include the `[corpus]` label detail that was explicitly documented in the source. The source spec states: "The label shows `[corpus]` when no path is given, otherwise the provided path." The original requirement omitted this detail.

The rest of the requirements document was already accurate, properly sourced, testable, and complete. No other issues were found.

     "content": "# vecsum\n\nFast hierarchical summarization of PDF documents using vector tree\n\n## Overview\n\nBuilds an unbalanced summary tree from PDF documents. Documents are chunked and embedded, then recursively summarized upward until a single vector represents each document. Directory-level summaries group related documents. Finding any summary is a single database lookup.\n\n## Demonstration\n\nExample PDFs are in `./extart/example-pdfs/`:\n\n```\nextart/example-pdfs/\n  cooking/        <- PDFs about cooking/recipes\n  programming/    <- PDFs about programming/tutorials\n```\n\nBuild the database:\n```\n./released/vecsum.exe --db-file ./vecsum.db --pdf-dir ./extart/example-pdfs/cooking --pdf-dir ./extart/example-pdfs/programming\n```\n\nQuery a summary:\n```\n./released/vecsum.exe --db-file ./vecsum.db --summarize\n./released/vecsum.exe --db-file ./vecsum.db --summarize ./extart/example-pdfs/cooking\n./released/vecsum.exe --db-file ./vecsum.db --summarize ./extart/example-pdfs/cooking/recipe1.pdf\n```\n\nSee [specs/COMMAND-LINE.md](specs/COMMAND-LINE.md) for full CLI documentation.\n\n## Output\n\n`./released/vecsum.exe` is a single standalone executable with no external dependencies. No .NET runtime, no DLLs, no separate SQLite extension files -- everything is bundled into one file.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. PDF documents are chunked by character count and embedded into vectors\n2. Chunks are grouped by topic boundaries (detected by LLM) and summarized\n3. Summaries are recursively grouped and summarized until one remains per document\n4. Document summaries are grouped by directory and summarized upward\n5. Querying any node's top retrieves its instant summary\n\nSee [specs/STRATEGY.md](specs/STRATEGY.md) for implementation details.\n",

      "text": "Now I have all the source documents. Let me analyze the requirements document against the sources:\n\n**Issues Found:**\n\n1. **Missing $REQ_CLI_001** - There's no REQ_CLI_001. The numbering starts at 002, which is unusual but not technically wrong.\n\n2. **$REQ_CLI_013 (Summary Output Format)** - The source shows \"Summary for: <path or [corpus]>\" but the requirement doesn't mention the `[corpus]` label case. Let me check the source again... Actually the requirement says \"optionally\" for build time which is correct, but it should mention `[corpus]` for when no path is given. This is incomplete.\n\n3. **$REQ_CLI_025 (Path Canonicalization)** - The source attribution says \"./specs/DB-SCHEMA.md\" but this is about CLI behavior. The spec COMMAND-LINE.md section \"--summarize\" also says \"Path must match a path that was ingested into the database\" but doesn't explicitly mention canonicalization. However, DB-SCHEMA.md section \"Path Canonicalization\" does say \"All paths are canonicalized before storing or querying. This ensures matches regardless of how the user specifies the path.\" This applies to CLI paths. The source is actually in DB-SCHEMA.md's \"Path Canonicalization\" section, so the source is accurate. The description is reasonable.\n\n4. **Missing requirement about help text** - The README mentions \"--help\" isn't explicitly specified, but the COMMAND-LINE.md spec doesn't mention a --help flag. The error handling section mentions \"prints help text\" but there's no --help argument documented, so no requirement needed.\n\n5. **Review each requirement against sources for accuracy:**\n\nLet me verify each requirement more carefully:\n\n- **$REQ_CLI_002**: Source says \"If the file does not exist, it will be created and the summary tree will be built from all `--pdf-dir` directories\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_003**: Source says \"If the file exists, it will be opened and used as-is (no rebuild)\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_004**: Source says \"Can be specified multiple times\" and \"(zero or more)\" in title - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_005**: Source says \"Only used when `--db-file` does not exist (during initial build)\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_007**: Source says \"Each subdirectory containing PDFs becomes a branch in the summary tree\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_008**: Source says \"If a directory path: prints the directory summary (dir_top node)\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_009**: Source says \"If a PDF file path: prints the document summary (doc_top node)\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_011**: Source says \"Build time: Printed after database creation\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_012**: Source says \"Summary lookup time: Printed after `--summarize` retrieval\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_013**: Source shows full format. Requirement is accurate but missing `[corpus]` label detail.\n- **$REQ_CLI_014**: Source example shows \"dot per database row written\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_015**: Source section \"Build and query in one command\" shows this - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_016**: Source says \"Any error prints help text...followed by the specific error message, then exits\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_017-024**: All match the error table in source - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_025**: Source is DB-SCHEMA.md Path Canonicalization section - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_026**: Source is README.md Output section - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_027**: Source says \"If no path given: prints the corpus summary (root node)\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_028-029**: Match error table - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_030**: Source says \"All PDFs in the directory and subdirectories (recursive)\" - Accurate \u2713\n- **$REQ_CLI_031-033**: Match --log-dir section - Accurate \u2713\n\n6. **Missing requirement for corpus label** - $REQ_CLI_013 mentions the format but doesn't capture that when no path is given, the label shows `[corpus]`. The source explicitly says \"The label shows `[corpus]` when no path is given, otherwise the provided path.\" This could be added.\n\n7. **Check for implied requirements** - Looking at the requirements, they all seem to test distinct behaviors. None appear to be implied by others.\n\n8. **Completeness check** - Is there anything in the source not covered?\n   - The usage line format isn't a testable requirement (it's documentation)\n   - The help text content itself (referenced in error handling) - there's mention of HELP-TEXT.txt but no explicit requirement about --help flag behavior. The spec doesn't define a --help flag, just that errors print help text.\n\nAfter review, the requirements document is quite good. The only issue I found is:\n\n**$REQ_CLI_013** should include the `[corpus]` label detail since it's explicitly documented in the source.\n\nLet me make this fix:"
