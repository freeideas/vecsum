# Req Fix 01 Cli [RESPONSE]
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-14-12-52-09-101
**Requirement:** N/A

## Response

Now I have all the source documentation. Let me review the requirements document against the rules.

**Analysis of `reqs/01_cli.md`:**

1. **Source Attribution** - All requirements have proper `**Source:**` lines. ✓

2. **Accuracy** - Requirements match the source documentation accurately. ✓

3. **Completeness** - Let me check if any behaviors are missing...
   - The spec mentions `--summarize` path must match a path ingested into the database (line 43) -- not explicitly a separate requirement, but covered by $REQ_CLI_020
   - SQLite Vector bundled into executable -- covered by $REQ_CLI_026 "no separate SQLite extension files"
   - All behaviors seem covered. ✓

4. **Testability** - All requirements describe observable behaviors. ✓

5. **Overspecification** - Requirements match source specificity. ✓

6. **Implied Requirements** - Let me check for redundancy:
   - $REQ_CLI_025 (path canonicalization) is observable behavior that enables matching -- not implied by other reqs
   - Error handling requirements are all distinct error conditions -- not implied by each other
   - No obvious redundancies. ✓

7. **Unique IDs** - All IDs are unique and follow the format. Note: IDs skip from $REQ_CLI_005 to $REQ_CLI_007 and from $REQ_CLI_009 to $REQ_CLI_011 (likely deleted requirements in past). This is fine -- not an issue. ✓

8. **No Invention** - All requirements trace to documented source. ✓

**One issue found:**

Looking at the example in the spec at lines 145-157, the error output format shows help text is printed **before** the error message, not after. Let me check $REQ_CLI_016:

Current: "On any error, the program prints help text followed by the specific error message, then exits."

Source (COMMAND-LINE.md line 147): "Any error prints help text (see [HELP-TEXT.txt](HELP-TEXT.txt)) followed by the specific error message, then exits."

This matches exactly -- no change needed.

**Second look - checking for missing $REQ_CLI_001 and $REQ_CLI_006, $REQ_CLI_010:**

The IDs have gaps (001, 006, 010 are missing). This is fine -- they were likely removed previously. No issue.

**Conclusion:** The requirements document is correct. No issues to fix.

The file is accurate and complete. All requirements have proper source attribution, match the source documentation, are testable, and have no implied redundancies. No changes are needed.

See [Path Canonicalization](#path-canonicalization).\n\n### directories\n\nTracks which directories were ingested.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE directories (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    path TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE         -- canonical directory path\n);\n```\n\n### documents\n\nTracks which PDF files were ingested.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE documents (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    directory_id INTEGER REFERENCES directories(id),\n    path TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,        -- canonical PDF file path\n    filename TEXT NOT NULL            -- just the filename for display\n);\n```\n\n## Indexes\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX idx_nodes_doc_path ON nodes(doc_path, node_type);\nCREATE INDEX idx_nodes_dir_path ON nodes(dir_path, node_type);\nCREATE INDEX idx_nodes_type ON nodes(node_type);\nCREATE INDEX idx_nodes_parent ON nodes(parent_id);\n```\n\n## Query Patterns\n\n### Get Document Summary (by PDF path)\n\n```sql\nSELECT content FROM nodes\nWHERE doc_path = :pdf_path AND node_type = 'doc_top';\n```\n\nExample (path is canonicalized before query):\n```sql\nSELECT content FROM nodes\nWHERE doc_path = 'c:/users/human/prjx/vecsum/testdocs/cooking/recipe1.pdf' AND node_type = 'doc_top';\n```\n\n### Get Directory Summary (by directory path)\n\n```sql\nSELECT content FROM nodes\nWHERE dir_path = :dir_path AND node_type = 'dir_top';\n```\n\nExample (path is canonicalized before query):\n```sql\nSELECT content FROM nodes\nWHERE dir_path = 'c:/users/human/prjx/vecsum/testdocs/cooking' AND node_type = 'dir_top';\n```\n\n### Get Corpus Summary\n\n```sql\nSELECT content FROM nodes\nWHERE node_type = 'root';\n```\n\n### Check if Path Exists\n\nTo determine if a user-provided path is a document or directory (canonicalize the path first):\n\n```sql\n-- Check if it's a document\nSELECT 1 FROM documents WHERE path = :canonical_path;\n\n-- Check if it's a directory\nSELECT 1 FROM directories WHERE path = :canonical_path;\n```\n\n### K-NN Search Across Raw Chunks\n\n```sql\nSELECT id, content, vec_distance(embedding, :query_vec) as distance\nFROM nodes\nWHERE node_type = 'chunk'\nORDER BY distance\nLIMIT :k;\n```\n\n### K-NN Within Document\n\n```sql\nSELECT id, content, node_type, vec_distance(embedding, :query_vec) as distance\nFROM nodes\nWHERE doc_path = :pdf_path\nORDER BY distance\nLIMIT :k;\n```\n\n## SQLite Vector\n\nSQLite and the SQLite Vector extension are bundled into the executable. No external downloads or setup required.\n\nThe vector extension provides `vec_distance()` for k-NN queries. See https://www.sqlite.ai/sqlite-vector for documentation on vector operations.\n\n## Path Canonicalization\n\nAll paths are canonicalized before storing or querying. This ensures matches regardless of how the user specifies the path.\n\n### Canonicalization Rules\n\n1. Resolve to absolute path (expand `.`, `..`, relative paths)\n2. Convert backslashes to forward slashes\n3. Remove trailing slashes from directories\n4. Use consistent casing (lowercase on Windows, preserve on Linux)\n\n### Example\n\nUser runs:\n```\nvecsum.exe --db-file ./db.sqlite --pdf-dir ./testdocs/cooking\nvecsum.exe --db-file ./db.sqlite --pdf-dir ../vecsum/testdocs/cooking\nvecsum.exe --db-file ./db.sqlite --pdf-dir C:\\Users\\Human\\Desktop\\prjx\\vecsum\\testdocs\\cooking\n```\n\nAll three store the same canonical path:\n```\nC:/Users/Human/Desktop/prjx/vecsum/testdocs/cooking\n```\n\nUser queries:\n```\nvecsum.exe --db-file ./db.sqlite --summarize ./testdocs/cooking\nvecsum.exe --db-file ./db.sqlite --summarize testdocs/cooking\nvecsum.exe --db-file ./db.sqlite --summarize C:\\Users\\Human\\Desktop\\prjx\\vecsum\\testdocs\\cooking\n```\n\nAll three canonicalize to the same path and find the summary.\n\n### C# Implementation\n\n```csharp\nstring CanonicalizePath(string path)\n{\n    // Resolve to absolute, normalize separators\n    string full = Path.GetFullPath(path);\n\n    // Convert to forward slashes\n    full = full.Replace('\\\\', '/');\n\n    // Remove trailing slash (except root like \"C:/\")\n    if (full.Length > 3 && full.EndsWith('/'))\n        full = full.TrimEnd('/');\n\n    // Lowercase on Windows for case-insensitive matching\n    if (OperatingSystem.IsWindows())\n        full = full.ToLowerInvariant();\n\n    return full;\n}\n```\n",
